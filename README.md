# US Bikeshare Data Analysis

This project is a Python script that analyzes bikeshare data from three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The script prompts the user to specify a city, month, and day of the week to analyze. It then provides various statistics and insights based on the selected filters.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need Python installed on your machine. Additionally, make sure you have the following files in your project directory:

- `bikeshare.py`: The main Python script for analyzing bikeshare data.
- `chicago.csv`: CSV file containing bikeshare data for Chicago.
- `new_york_city.csv`: CSV file containing bikeshare data for New York City.
- `washington.csv`: CSV file containing bikeshare data for Washington.

## Usage

To run the script, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

```bash
python bikeshare.py
```


Follow the prompts to specify a city, month, and day of the week for analysis. The script will then display various statistics and insights based on the selected filters.

## Features

- **Filtering**: Allows users to filter data by city, month, and day of the week.
- **Statistics**: Provides statistics on the most frequent times of travel, popular stations and trips, trip durations, and user demographics.
